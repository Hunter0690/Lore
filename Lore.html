<h2>Adventurers Guild System</h2>
<pre>
Purpose
The Adventurers’ Guild serves as a neutral organization, uniting mercenaries, explorers, hunters, and warriors under one banner. It regulates adventuring work, provides missions, ensures fair payment, and prevents chaos caused by unchecked rogue adventurers.

Ranks (E → S)
Each rank is earned by completing quests, showing capability, and passing occasional guild evaluations.
E-Rank (Novice):
    • Fresh recruits, trainees, or amateurs.
    • Tasks: simple deliveries, herb gathering, pest extermination.
    • Treated as disposable labor, often underestimated.
D-Rank (Apprentice):
    • Have survived enough to show reliability.
    • Tasks: low-risk monster hunting, caravan escorting, light dungeon exploration.
    • Start forming small parties.
C-Rank (Professional):
    • Considered competent and recognized by locals.
    • Tasks: mid-tier monster hunts, dungeon clearing, dangerous escorts, defense contracts.
    • Allowed access to restricted guild libraries and better equipment loans.
B-Rank (Veteran):
    • Experienced, hardened adventurers.
    • Tasks: large-scale monster threats, fortress/dungeon leadership, subjugation of dangerous beasts.
    • Influence: often respected by nobles, sometimes hired for military operations.
A-Rank (Elite):
    • Renowned adventurers, feared and admired alike.
    • Tasks: nation-level threats, ancient ruins, high-risk dungeon bosses, assassination of high-value targets.
    • Influence: personal reputation rivals minor lords.
S-Rank (Legend):
    • Rare individuals, often only a handful in the entire continent.
    • Tasks: world-level crises, demon lords, primordial beasts, or disasters beyond armies.
    • Influence: kings and rulers treat them with caution, some are whispered about as living myths.

Guild Structure
    • Guildmaster: Oversees each branch, often an ex-A or S rank adventurer.
    • Receptionists: Handle contracts, paperwork, and mediate between adventurers and clients.
    • Enforcers: Guild-appointed officers who ensure adventurers obey guild laws.

Guild Laws
    1. Do not kill or harm fellow guild members without sanction.
    2. Do not cheat or swindle clients.
    3. Do not interfere with other guild branches’ jurisdiction.
    4. High crimes (treason, mass slaughter, aiding world-level threats) = permanent blacklisting or execution.

Currency & Rewards
    • Payment depends on rank and mission difficulty.
    • Adventurers earn Guild Credits, which can be exchanged for coin, equipment, spell scrolls, or favors.
    • High-rank adventurers often receive custom quests directly from nobility or nations.
</pre>
</div>

<!-- Hero System -->
<div class="section" id="hero">
<h2>The Hero System</h2>
<pre>
Origin
In times of great crisis, the world’s Will — some call it the Primordial Balance, others the Gods’ Accord — chooses individuals to bear the title of Hero. Unlike adventurers, heroes are bound by fate, carrying destinies that shake nations and rewrite history.

Hero Ranks & Recognition
Unlike the guild’s letter-ranks, heroes are classified by Titles, reflecting their deeds and divine recognition.
Chosen (Awakened):
    • Recently blessed, often unaware of full potential.
    • Myth says many “Chosen” are ordinary people from other worlds, pulled at random.
Guardian:
    • Protectors of a region, often defeating great threats or saving a city.
    • Begin to attract followers and legends.
Champion:
    • Renowned across nations, feared by enemies.
    • Capable of clashing with generals, demon nobles, or calamity beasts.
Paragon:
    • Symbolic figures, embodying hope and fear.
    • Tales of their battles spread across continents.
    • Often granted relics by gods.
Mythic Hero:
    • Rare few who rise beyond mortality.
    • Their names become eternal — recorded in holy texts, whispered in prayers.
    • Some vanish after their great battle, others ascend to godhood.

Myths of Reincarnated Heroes
    1. The Stranger’s Mark – Legends say reincarnated heroes from another world (often “Earth”) carry unknown knowledge, strange tactics, and innovations no native could conceive. Some speak of weapons of fire and thunder, or strategies that changed the tide of wars.
    2. The Price of Summoning – In ancient tales, summoning a hero from another world required great sacrifice: kingdoms trading hundreds of lives, or even sealing away part of their history. Because of this, many kingdoms fear the ritual, even if desperate.
    3. The Hidden Ones – Not all reincarnated souls become heroes. Some were said to hide among peasants or adventurers, shaping the world subtly with Earth-born knowledge. A few were feared and hunted as “Heretics of the Gods” for rejecting their heroic destiny.
    4. The Eternal Return – Oldest myths claim the same souls are reborn repeatedly across ages, always from Earth, always when the world faces collapse. Each new life carries faint memories of the last — dreams of battles they never fought, or grief over worlds long gone.

The Hero’s Rights & Burdens
    • Rights: Heroes are recognized by nations, given authority above military officers, free passage through cities, and access to divine relics.
    • Burden: They are bound by divine compulsion — a subtle push of fate — to confront world-ending threats. Some resist, but resisting too much can twist their souls.

Guild vs. Hero Distinction
    • Adventurers seek coin, fame, and survival.
    • Heroes are living myths chosen by fate, whether they want it or not.

    • Ogres – Hulking, destructive creatures, often enslaved by demons.
    • Dire Wolves – Pack hunters, large enough to bring down horses.
    • Wyverns – Lesser dragon-kin, terrorize trade routes and villages.

    • Dreamweavers – Hallucination-inducing silk, lure prey into traps.
    • Abyssfang Broodmother – Calamity-class, spawns endless swarms.
    • The Nameless Hunger – Evolving anomaly; unpredictable, feared even by demons.

    • Nightmares – Shadowy steeds that carry riders across dimensions.
    • Pitfiends – Demon generals, strong enough to destroy cities alone.
    • Voidspawn – Monsters that defy reality, born of primordial chaos.

    • A–S Rank adventurers & Heroes → confront liches, broodmothers, world serpents, and abyssal horrors.

<h2>The Twelvefold Celestium (Pantheon)</h2>
<pre>
The Twelvefold Celestium — Pantheon of the Mortal Realms
Created by the Primordials, these twelve gods govern reality. Their alliances shift, some war, some love, some deceive—and two of them constantly bicker, driving the entire pantheon insane.

Heroes are considered Children of the Blessing, empowered by gods but ultimately free-willed.

How Primordials View Heroes
    • Primordials do NOT choose heroes—they choose successors, world-menders, or pivot points in fate.
    • They grant power sparingly; each blessing is world-shaking.
    • They rarely manifest; their will is known through:
        ◦ omens
        ◦ cosmic disturbances
        ◦ ancestral memories
        ◦ resonance with the soul
Their attitude toward heroes:
    • Isabella admires human courage → often guides isekai heroes.
    • Malfurion respects strength through suffering → tests heroes brutally.
    • Nicol judges heroes’ wisdom → will empower those who evolve.
    • Æowyn values harmony → helps heroes who heal rather than destroy.
    • Dwargon helps heroes who craft, build, or protect.
    • Lunara enjoys heroes who bring joy or chaos.
    • Shinoburu favors heroes embracing instinct and truth.
